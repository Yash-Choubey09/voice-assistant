# Voice-Enabled AI Chatbot 🎤

This is a personal project — an AI-powered chatbot that listens, understands, and responds using voice.  
It combines **Speech Recognition**, **Text-to-Speech**, and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** to create a simple virtual assistant that can talk, answer basic queries, and act as a personal diary through voice commands.

## 🚀 Overview
The project focuses on creating a **hands-free chatbot** that interacts naturally with users.  
It can:
- Listen to voice commands  
- Convert speech into text  
- Process queries and respond with voice  
- Save notes or diary entries spoken by the user  
- Analyze basic sentiment (positive/negative mood)
